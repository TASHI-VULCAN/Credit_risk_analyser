# Aim: Credit Risk Prediction & Loan Optimisation
- This project focuses on financial risk assessment, Machine learning and automation, making it highly relevant for fintech, banking, and hedge fund roles
- Develope a ML model to predict credit default risk, automate risk assessment using API-driven data extraction, and optimise loan allocation for maximum returns with minimal risk
- Also, to find a new scoring methods to aprove a loan, apart from the traditional inputs, which can be correlated to approving loans and decresed the risk value. 

## Key components:
1. Data Extraction & Automation
    - Scrape or extract real-world financial data using an API (e.g., LendingClub, FRED, or a bank’s open API)
    - Automate data updates and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL
2. Credit Risk Modeling with Machine Learning
    - Train a classification model (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, or Random Forest) to predict default probability
    - Perform feature engineering on credit score, income, loan amount, and payment history
3. Loan Portfolio Optimization
    - Apply Markowitz Portfolio Theory to optimize loan allocation, balancing risk and return
    - Implement Stochastic Gradient Descent to dynamically adjust lending decisions 
4. Risk Evaluation & Visualization
    - Use ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curves, and Confusion Matrices to evaluate model performance
    - Visualize risk distributions and portfolio efficiency with Seaborn & Matplotlib

## Real world use cases & impact:
1. Used in Banking & Fintech Companies
    - Banks and fintech companies (e.g., LendingClub, Klarna, Revolut, Monzo) use credit risk models to assess borrowers before approving loans
    - Your model can automate loan decisions, reducing default rates and improving lending efficiency 
2. Helps Optimize Loan Allocation & Minimize Risk
    - Instead of lending randomly or based on traditional credit scores, an optimized machine learning model can minimize defaults and maximize profitability
    - Portfolio optimization ensures higher returns with lower risk, which is critical for hedge funds and financial institutions 
3. Deployable as an API or Web App
    - The model can be integrated into a fintech app where users apply for loans, and the system instantly evaluates their risk
    - Could be deployed via Flask/FastAPI and integrated into an automated loan approval system 
4. Regulatory & Compliance Applications
    - Banks are required to justify lending decisions to regulators. Your model can provide data-driven insights to comply with Basel regulations 
    - Helps in reducing bias in lending by making decisions based on data, not just credit history 

## Make it more deployable:
-  Store model results in a PostgreSQL or Firebase database
-  Build a Flask or Streamlit app where users enter their details and get an instant risk score
-  Deploy the model via AWS Lambda or Google Cloud for real-world integration

## Note:
Since this project requires datasets such as credit scoore, name, address, etc., which is not legal for an individual to obtain, it is best to use synthetic data from kaggle like LendinClub Dataset, which is a public dataset
Also we can use an alternative scoring models like: 
- Bank transaction history instead of credit scores
- Behavioral analytics (e.g., spending patterns, savings habits)
- Social media data (some fintech firms analyze digital presence)

## Next step would be to deploy the model via a streamlit app:
The steps required to deploy the model:
- Use Flask or FastAPI - Wrap the model in an API
- Deploy on a cloud platform - Options include AWS, GCP, Render, or Hugging Face Spaces
- Create a Frontend (Optional) – Use Streamlit or Flask to make an interactive web app

## Benifits of Deployment:
- Use the model in real-world applications (e.g., loan approval systems)
- Allow real-time predictions via API calls (useful for banks & fintech)
- Showcase your work in job applications by providing a live demo

 ## How Data Gets Processed in the API:
 - Client Sends Data (e.g., a request from Postman or another application)
 - FastAPI Receives Input → The input JSON is parsed and converted into the required format
 - API Preprocesses Data (if needed) → Example: Scaling numerical values using scaler.pkl
 - Model Makes a Prediction → The trained model (credit_risk_model.pkl) processes the input
 - API Returns the Prediction → The client gets the risk score (or approval decision)

 ## What we need to ensure:
- The API expects the correct input format (match feature names & data types)
- The model and scaler are correctly loaded inside the API
- The API is properly tested with sample inputs before deployment

    - Dockerized the API for consistent environments across development and production
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, improving deployment speed and reliability

## Advantages of Docker and CI/CD for Personal Projects:
1. Docker:
    - Consistency in Environments: It ensures that your code runs the same way on different machines (your laptop, someone else’s machine, or the cloud)
    - Scalability: If you decide to deploy your model on a larger scale, Docker would make it much easier to spin up instances of your model
    - Learnability: It's a valuable skill, as Docker is widely used in production environments, particularly in cloud-based or scalable applications 
2. CI/CD:
    - Faster Development & Testing: It automates the testing and deployment of your code, which could save you time in the long run
    - Code Quality: Even as a solo developer, automating testing can help ensure your code remains robust as it evolves
    - Job Market Appeal: Companies look for developers with CI/CD knowledge because it’s a standard practice for modern software delivery 
3. To Dockerize or Not?
    - If you're learning and want to broaden your skills for future job applications, it might be worth experimenting with Docker and CI/CD
    - If the main focus is data science and model performance, you can skip it for now and focus on building a strong, effective model and its real-world impact

## To develop an app and a website with this model:
1. What Will You Need?
    - Frontend: A simple UI (could use tools like React, Vue, or Flask for quick development)
    - Backend: FastAPI (which you're already using), or Flask, which will handle API requests and serve the model
    - Database: If you need to store user data or predictions, you might want to use a SQL or NoSQL database
    - Deployment: You could deploy on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Docker could be useful if you deploy to a cloud server, but it's not mandatory for small projects
2. Simplified Approach
    - Building a basic frontend (using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, or a lightweight framework like Flask)
    - Integrating the backend API for making predictions (using FastAPI)
    - Hosting the app on platforms like Heroku (which is easy to deploy on and doesn’t require Docker initially) 


## What is so special about the real time aspect of this project?
    Not all models are real-time. While many models process data in batches, my project focuses on real-time credit risk predictions. The model is deployed via a FastAPI service, which allows it to provide instant risk scores as soon as new loan application data is provided. This enables immediate decision-making, which is crucial for applications like loan approvals where speed is important
## Real-World Example for this project:
    If a bank or fintech company were to use your system, the data would come from live loan applications or existing customer data pulled from an API or database. As soon as a new loan application is submitted, the model processes the data in real-time and provides a risk assessment (i.e., how likely the applicant is to default on the loan)
## How to Explain the Data Flow in a Job Interview: If asked about where the data is coming from, explaination:
    The real-time model processes data from live sources, such as loan application forms submitted by users or external financial data APIs (e.g., credit scores, income information). Once the data is received by the FastAPI service, it is instantly passed to the model for risk assessment and prediction. This allows financial institutions to make immediate decisions regarding loan approvals, with the model’s predictions integrated directly into their systems


## How This Code Works:
1. FastAPI:
    - The app defines an API endpoint (/predict/) that receives a loan application request with user details (like credit_score, transaction_history, etc.)
    - You can test the API using tools like Postman or Swagger UI (FastAPI automatically generates one for you)
2. Pickling the Model:
    - The trained machine learning model is saved using Pickle and loaded into the app on start-up. In the code above, this is done with pickle.load()
3. Fetching Real-Time Data:
    - The fetch_real_time_data() function simulates fetching data from an external API (e.g., a financial API for transaction history or income)
    - Replace the API URL and data processing with real API calls that align with the data your model needs
4. Preprocessing the Data:
    - The preprocess_data() function standardizes the data (you can modify it to match your actual preprocessing steps)
5. Model Prediction:
    - The data is passed into the pre-trained model (model.predict()) to make a real-time prediction for credit risk
6. Response:
    - If the model predicts 1 (approved), the loan is approved. If it’s 0 (rejected), the loan is denied. The status and risk_score are returned in the response 

## Flow of the project:(step by step)
1. Train the Model (in Jupyter Notebook with VS Code):
    - Use synthetic data (from Kaggle or your own dataset).
    - Implement your Monte Carlo simulation and Random Forest model.
    - Train the model, evaluate it, and save the model (using Pickle). 
2. Save the Model:
    - Once the model is trained, pickle it so that you don't need to retrain it every time the API is called. 
3. Create a FastAPI Web Service (in a Separate Python File):
    - In a new Python file (in the same directory as the training notebook), set up a FastAPI app.
    - Load the pickled model into the FastAPI app so it can be used for predictions.
    - Set up API endpoints to fetch live data (e.g., using an external API or user input).
    - Preprocess this live data, pass it to the model for prediction, and return the result. 
4. Deploy the FastAPI App:
    - You can now deploy the FastAPI app (locally or on a server) that will accept real-time data requests, feed the data into the trained model, and return predictions like loan approvals or risk assessments.
